pkg_source="no-download-file"

# Optional.
# An array of package dependencies needed at runtime. You can refer to packages
# at three levels of specificity: `origin/package`, `origin/package/version`, or
# `origin/package/version/release`.
# pkg_deps=(core/glibc)

# Optional.
# An array of the package dependencies needed only at build time.
# pkg_build_deps=(core/make core/gcc)

# Optional.
# An array of paths, relative to the final install of the software, where
# libraries can be found. Used to populate LD_FLAGS and LD_RUN_PATH for
# software that depends on your package.
# pkg_lib_dirs=(lib)

# Optional.
# An array of paths, relative to the final install of the software, where
# binaries can be found. Used to populate PATH for software that depends on
# your package.
pkg_bin_dirs=(bin)

# Optional.
# The command for the supervisor to execute when starting a service. You can
# omit this setting if your package is not intended to be run directly by a
# supervisor of if your plan contains a run hook in hooks/run.
pkg_svc_run="yesod"

# Optional.
# An associative array representing configuration data which should be gossiped to peers. The keys
# in this array represent the name the value will be assigned and the values represent the toml path
# to read the value.
# pkg_exports=(
#   [host]=srv.address
#   [port]=srv.port
#   [ssl-port]=srv.ssl.port
# )

# Optional.
# An array of `pkg_exports` keys containing default values for which ports that this package
# exposes. These values are used as sensible defaults for other tools. For example, when exporting
# a package to a container format.
# pkg_exposes=(port ssl-port)

# Optional.
# An associative array representing services which you depend on and the configuration keys that
# you expect the service to export (by their `pkg_exports`). These binds *must* be set for the
# supervisor to load the service. The loaded service will wait to run until it's bind becomes
# available. If the bind does not contain the expected keys, the service will not start
# successfully.
# pkg_binds=(
#   [database]="port host"
# )

# Optional.
# Same as `pkg_binds` but these represent optional services to connect to.
# pkg_binds_optional=(
#   [storage]="port host"
# )

# The default implementation removes the HAB_CACHE_SRC_PATH/$pkg_dirname folder
# in case there was a previously-built version of your package installed on

# There is no default implementation of this callback. At this point in the

# environment variables have been set, so you can use this callback to perform
# any actions before the package starts building, such as exporting variables,
# adding symlinks, and so on.

# The default implementation is to run make install on the source files and
# place the compiled binaries or libraries in HAB_CACHE_SRC_PATH/$pkg_dirname,
# which resolves to a path like /hab/cache/src/packagename-version/. It uses
# this location because of do_build() using the --prefix option when calling the
# configure script. You should override this behavior if you need to perform
# custom installation steps, such as copying files from HAB_CACHE_SRC_PATH to
# specific directories in your package, or installing pre-built binaries into
# your package.
do_install() {

# debugging symbols. You should override this behavior if you want to change
# how the binaries are stripped, which additional binaries located in
# subdirectories might also need to be stripped, or whether you do not want the
# binaries stripped at all.
